# CleverBombHack
A web browser extension that allows fast and easy passguessing for the FHSD Clever sign-on page. This extension was designed for Active Directory.
### Guide
Go to the latest release, and download the one of the files named cleverhack.xpi or cleverhack.crx. *(xpi for firefox, crx for chrome or edge.)* Once you download the extension, **go to Clever and click sign in with Active Directory. This will NOT work with the option "Sign in with Google."** Once you are on the sign-on page, click on the CleverBomb extension button (it looks like the picture at the top of this page) and enter the user's sign on details. They go as listed: Username example: *"fhsd.local\jdoe123"* You can find the last three digits of the user's lunch number in their email. Example: "jdoe**123**". Next, click the "Start" button. Once the page reloads, click the link labeled "View credentials from last attempt" and **make sure the last three digits of the password match the ones that you originally put in.**
